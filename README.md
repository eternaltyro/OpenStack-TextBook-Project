OpenStack-TextBook-Project
==========================

OpenStack textbook project is an initiative to write a decent guide that can be used as a textbook for students wanting to learn OpenStack related concepts.


In the future
=====

* The text book could be uploaded to WikiBooks (https://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* Could be used as support material in Wikiversity (https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikibooks)
* Maybe a Moodle site? Or am I wishing for too much?
*
